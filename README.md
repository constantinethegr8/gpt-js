# testgpt-js

An HTML-based chat application that uses the OpenAI API.

It uses the streaming API for the GPT-3.5-turbo model and, additionally to writing text, tables and code, is capable of creating formulas and simple SVG images.

The drawings are not very good yet, but better than nothing. You can improve them using the chat.

### Usage:

Create the file `js/api_key.js` that defines an OpenAI API key like this:
```js
const api_key = "sk-6AQdmaPySsomeW2randomCdmaPIkey0HdmaEI";
```

### Screenshot:

This screenshot was "randomly selected" because its output was ok-ish ;)
